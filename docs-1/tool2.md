# Tool 2
Here is where I write text about the second tool.

It contains the same code-snippit as the landing page [readme.md](readme.md).

```bash
VAR="some string"
CODE=${VAR} + "text"
for i in ${ARR[@]}; do
    # This is horribly wrong
    echo $i
done
```

+ And a link to [guide header lev 2-1](guide.md#heading-lev-2-1)

+ And not much more.

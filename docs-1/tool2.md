# Tool 2
Here is where I write text about the second tool.

It contains the same code-snippit as the landing page [readme.md](readme.md).

```bash
# bash syntax highlighting
VAR="some string"
CODE=${VAR} + "text"
for i in ${ARR[@]}; do
    # This is horribly wrong
    echo $i
done
```

```html
<!-- html -->

<bold> classics </bold>
```

```r
# This is R-code
helloworld <- dplyr::mutate(ds, foo)
print("hello world")
ds %>% mutate()
```

```docker
RUN some stuff
CMD some other stuff
ADD this

# and finally
ENTRYPOINT ["some", "string"]

```

```markdown

# So, highlight this then

* As you were.
* Don't be afraid.

`we will not yield`. **Right**?
```

```yaml
# yaml stuff
some:
- high tech
guru: of the highest order

```

```json
# json stuff
{json: {list: {item}}}

```

+ And a link to [guide header lev 2-1](guide.md#heading-lev-2-1)

+ And not much more.
